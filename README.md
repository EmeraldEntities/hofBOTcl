# hofBOTcl
So I made this a year ago to test out discord.js and discord bot api and it was a fun little small side project.
Do keep in mind that I don't know much about coding node.js properly so a lot of this is really scuffed.

## notes
I don't actually know if you can host this since it's set up to a specific mySQL thing on my computer, and the configs weren't pushed to git. Again, this is just a test project that I made.

## completed
- command manager
- mysql functionality! :))

## todo if i ever feel like it
- hosting 24/7 using something
- make it hostable on anyone's computer
- more commands? idk
- filler option

please don't judge
